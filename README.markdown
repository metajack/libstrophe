libcouplet is a fork of libstrophe - a lightweight XMPP client library
written in C. Goal of the fork is make library suitable for multi-thread
applications.

## Build Instructions

If you are building from a source control checkout, run:

In addition, if you wish to run the unit tests, you will need the
check package.
