0.11.0
	- SASL EXTERNAL support (XEP-0178)
	- Client certificate can be provided for TLS negotiation. If the
	  certificate contains a single xmppAddr and JID is not provided with
	  xmpp_conn_set_jid(), the xmppAddr is chosen as JID
	- <stream> element contains "from" attribute over TLS connections now
	- GnuTLS can be selected optionally with configure script
	- New API:
		- xmpp_conn_set_client_cert()
		- xmpp_conn_cert_xmppaddr_num()
		- xmpp_conn_cert_xmppaddr()

0.10.1
	- Fixed compilation error when LibreSSL is used
	- Fixed crash when NULL is provided as password

0.10.0
	- Coding style has been unified
	- SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-512 support
	- c-ares support
	- LibreSSL support
	- Introduced global timed handlers that fire periodically regardless of
	  connections status, such a handler can be used to implement deferred
	  re-connection
	- examples/register implements XEP-0077
	- Fixed issue with IPv6 on Windows (#153)
	- Improved portability across systems such as Haiku, Windows
	- New API:
		- xmpp_stanza_get_child_by_name_and_ns()
		- xmpp_conn_is_connecting()
		- xmpp_conn_is_connected()
		- xmpp_conn_is_disconnected()
		- xmpp_stanza_new_from_string()
		- xmpp_stanza_add_child_ex()
		- xmpp_stanza_get_context()
		- xmpp_stanza_reply_error()
		- xmpp_global_timed_handler_add()
		- xmpp_global_timed_handler_delete()

0.9.3
	- PLAIN mechanism is used only when no other mechanisms are supported
	- Legacy authentication is disabled by default, can be enabled with
	  connection flag XMPP_CONN_FLAG_LEGACY_AUTH
	- Session is not established if it is optional
	- Fixed a bug causing a reused connection not to cleanup properly
	- Improved debug logging in OpenSSL module
	- Few memory leaks fixed

0.9.2
	- OpenSSL tls module verifies certificate by default. Set flag
	  XMPP_CONN_FLAG_TRUST_TLS to ignore result of the verification
	- Certificate hostname verification is forced for openssl-1.0.2 and
	  newer
	- OpenSSL tls module disables insecure SSLv2 SSLv3 and TLSv1
	- Support of handlers with the same callback function, but different
	  userdata
	- System handlers are deleted on xmpp_conn_t reconnection. Old system
	  handlers could cause problems
	- Default timeout for xmpp_run() is increased from 1 millisecond to 1
	  second in order to reduce CPU consumption
	- Reduced memory usage in expat module
	- New functions:
		- xmpp_error_new()
		- xmpp_send_error()
		- xmpp_ctx_set_timeout()
		- xmpp_sha1_digest()

0.9.1
	- Fixed bug #95 (DNS lookup failing on Cygwin)
	- Removed dependency on the check package

0.9.0
	- IPv6 support
	- Legacy SSL support
	- Initial Android support
	- Resolver returns all SRV records instead of one. Lookup is performed
	  according to RFC2052
	- xmpp_connect_raw() provides access to a xmpp_conn object just after
	  establishing TCP connection. This allows to implement in-band
	  registration, authentication mechanisms or serverless messaging
	- xmpp_conn_t object is reusable now and can be reconnected with saving
	  all handlers, flags, jid and password
	- New API:
		- xmpp_uuid_gen()
		- xmpp_connect_raw()
		- xmpp_conn_open_stream_default()
		- xmpp_conn_open_stream()
		- xmpp_conn_tls_start()
		- xmpp_conn_get_flags()
		- xmpp_conn_set_flags()
		- xmpp_conn_set_keepalive()
		- xmpp_conn_is_secured()
		- xmpp_stanza_del_attribute()
		- xmpp_stanza_get_to()
		- xmpp_stanza_get_from()
		- xmpp_stanza_set_to()
		- xmpp_stanza_set_from()
		- xmpp_stanza_reply()
		- xmpp_message_new()
		- xmpp_message_get_body()
		- xmpp_message_set_body()
		- xmpp_iq_new()
		- xmpp_presence_new()
	- Exposed private API:
		- xmpp_jid_new()
		- xmpp_jid_bare()
		- xmpp_jid_node()
		- xmpp_jid_domain()
		- xmpp_jid_resource()
		- xmpp_stanza_get_attribute_count()
		- xmpp_stanza_get_attributes()

0.8.8
	- XML namespace support
	- XEP-0114 support

0.8.7
	- SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication mechanism
	- pkg-config support
